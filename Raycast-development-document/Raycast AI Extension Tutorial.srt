00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,759
we've just launched AI extensions and
我们刚刚启动了AI扩展名，
2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,560
it's a whole new way to interact with the extensions in raycast it opens up
这是与Raycast中扩展的互动的全新方法
3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,120
new possibilities enabling users to interact with these extensions in
新的可能性使用户能够与这些扩展相互作用
4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,039
natural language using one or multiple extensions at once and today I want to

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,880
show you how they work so you can build or enhance an existing extension from
向您展示它们的工作方式，以便您可以从中构建或增强现有的扩展
6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,439
our store so this video is aimed at developers but if you don't know how to
我们的商店，因此该视频针对开发人员，但是如果您不知道该怎么
7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,679
code I would recommend that you stick around anyway because including AI
代码我建议您无论如何都会坚持下去，因为包括AI
8
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,360
extensions is really easy and I'm going to try and Vibe code with cursa and
扩展真的很容易，我将尝试使用Cursa和Cursa和
9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,800
that's something I've never done before so let's see how that
那是我以前从未做过的事情，所以让我们看看如何
10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,399
goes here we have a very basic extension that just renders some static data in a
去这里，我们有一个非常基本的扩展名，仅在一个中呈现一些静态数据
11
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,039
list this extension is not really useful but it's simple enough just to go over

12
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,680
the basic concepts of an AI extension and that's going to help you understand
AI扩展的基本概念，这将帮助您理解
13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,160
how to build your own so the first thing we want to do is
如何构建自己的第一件事是
14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,840
create a new directory in the source and call it tools and in here we're going to
在源中创建一个新目录并将其称为工具，在这里我们将要解决
15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,240
create a file called films. TS we're going to take the exact same data as
创建一个称为胶片的文件。 TS我们将采用与
16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,960
before and we're just going to put it in here we create a const I like to call it
以前，我们只是要把它放在这里，我们创建一个const，我喜欢称呼它
17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:28,680
tool where we just return the data and then we export default tool right once
我们刚刚返回数据然后我们正确导出默认工具的工具
18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,240
we do this the next step is to go to packet Json so we can tell raycast that
我们这样做的下一步是去数据包JSON，以便我们可以告诉Raycast
19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,640
there's this tool available as you can see here cursor is
有此工具可用，因为您可以在此处看到光标是
20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,119
already being quite helpful and giving it a name this name needs to match your

文件名称标题和描述，我们没有其他需要做的
22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,880
and when I open up this extension in raycast we can see that now we have this
当我在Raycast中打开此扩展名时，我们可以看到现在我们有了这个
23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,360
AI extension before we could go into this normal command and see a list of
在进入这个普通命令之前，AI扩展
24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,600
the data but now we can go into this other command and I can get that same
数据，但现在我们可以进入另一个命令，我可以得到相同的

[Music]
[音乐]
29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,360
or interacting with it just through natural language
或仅通过自然语言与之互动
30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,000
so just to recap an AI extension is basically an extension that consists of
因此，仅仅回顾AI扩展，基本上是一个扩展程序，它由
31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,640
one or more tools a tool is just a typescript file that returns a function
一个或多个工具工具只是返回函数的打字稿文件

33
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,640
file system or whatever you want rcast then

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,680
exposes this extension through this at menion UI that you've just seen and lets
通过您刚刚看到的Menion UI公开此扩展
35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,879
users interact with it through natural language then it figures out which tool

36
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,720
to use and what to do but now we're going to do something a little bit more
